## Rainbowfy your images with the LGBT flag!

This is a simple CLI PHP script that will apply the LGBT flag to your images as an overlay.

**To run this...**

It's simple to run from the command line.

```
php rainbow.php <<path_to_image>>
```

For example, say I have an image `./my-photo.jpg`, I would rainbowfy it by running `php rainbow.php ./my-photo.jpg`
